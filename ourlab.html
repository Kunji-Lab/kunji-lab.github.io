            <p><strong> Edmund Kunji </strong><br> Principal Investigator </br> </p>
            <p> I started my PhD in October 2018 and am working on the identification of mitochondrial transporters, with a scholarship from the Aker Foundation. I am fascinated by trying to understand basic mechanisms of life. I did my BSc in Molecular Biology at the University of Bergen, Norway, and obtained my MSc from the same university, where I did my thesis on the generation and maintenance of the mitochondrial NAD pool. I enjoy sports, and play polo here at the University of Cambridge. </p>

            <p> I studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, majoring in biochemistry, before completing a PhD at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit under the supervision of Professor Judy Hirst. I am currently the laboratory manager for the mitochondrial carriers group, where I study <a href="/structures">structural and functional aspects of mitochondrial transport</a>. In my spare time, I enjoy travelling (with a particular passion for waterfalls), feeding ducks and squirrels, and reading.</p>

            <p> I am a biochemist with special interest in transmembrane transport proteins important for human pathophysiology. My recent work focuses on the function of transporters <a href="/pyruvate"> central to</a> <a href="/calcium">human metabolism</a>, their connection to human diseases and their potential use as drug targets. I am also affiliated with Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge where I study the molecular mechanisms causing <a href="/citrin"> citrin deficiency</a> in a project funded by <a href="https://citrinfoundation.org/"> Citrin Foundation. </a></p>

            <p> I have joined Prof. Kunji's lab in March 2018, supported by the Royal Society fellowship. I am interested in membrane transport proteins and, role in cell physiology and their implications.  My current work focuses on <a href="/structures"> new structures of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier </a>to understand the molecular basis of transport better. Currently I am supported by the MRC funding.I received my master's degree in Biochemistry at the G.B. Pant University, Pantnagar. I conducted my graduate research in Dr Suresh's lab, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory Pune, where I studied the structure-function relation of the gut microbial enzyme involved in the bile acid homeostasis. I enjoy travelling, poetry writing and sports.</p>

            <p> I started my PhD in January 2018. I am currently working on the characterisation of the off-target binding of drugs to the human ADP/ATP carrier. I am also establishing an assay to analyse the <a href="/identification"> substrate specificity </a>and <a href="/substrates">proton coupling properties</a> of the human citrate carrier. I am funded by a BBSRC case award with GlaxoSmithKline as an industrial partner. I did my BSc in Genetics at Queen Mary university, London. Subsequently, I obtained my MSc in Molecular medicine from Imperial College London where I worked on uncovering a novel mechanism for increased oxidative stress resistance and its effect on longevity in Drosophila.</p>
