We've 3D printed some carriers, some cardiolipins, and some ATP molecules! Look how cute they are! This is a great way to truly get an idea of what the protein looks like.


We used a Creality Ender 3 Pro with Prima EasyPrint PLA. Prusa software was used for slicing and the settings adjusted to ensure that support was easy to remove. The overall print took between four and five hours. The models shown have the PDB IDs 6GCI and 1OKC.
